A HashMap in Java is a part of the java.util package and is used to store key-value pairs in a hash table-based data structure. It provides fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations by using hashing.
Key Characteristics of HashMap
- Key-Value Storage: Stores data in the form of key-value pairs.
- Allows Null Values: Allows one null key and multiple null values.
- Unordered: Does not maintain any order of insertion.
- Non-Synchronized: Not thread-safe by default.
- Performance: Provides average O(1) time complexity for basic operations like put() and get().
Internal Working of HashMap
When you insert an entry (key, value) into a HashMap, it works as follows:
- Computing Hash Code: Java computes a hash code from the key using hashCode().
- Index Calculation: Converts the hash code into an index using a formula like (hash & (capacity-1)) to find the bucket.
- Storing in Buckets: The key-value pair is placed into the bucket at the computed index.
- Handling Collisions: If multiple keys hash to the same bucket, Java resolves collisions using:
- Separate chaining (Linked List): Keys with the same index are stored in a linked list.
- Balanced Tree (Java 8+): When collisions exceed a threshold, Java converts linked lists into balanced trees for better performance.

Best Practices
- Use Immutable Keys (e.g., String) to prevent unexpected changes.
- Avoid using null keys excessively as they can make debugging harder.
- Prefer LinkedHashMap if insertion order matters.
- Use ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations in multithreading environments.


Real-World Performance Comparison
| Scenario | Best Choice |
| Single-threaded app | HashMap (fastest, no overhead) |
| Multi-threaded read-heavy | ConcurrentHashMap (non-blocking reads) |
| Multi-threaded write-heavy | ConcurrentHashMap (fine-grained locking) |
| Cache for microservices | ConcurrentHashMap (safe concurrent access) |

Which One Should You Use?
| Cache Type | Best Use Case |
| ConcurrentHashMap | Fast in-memory cache for a single JVM |
| Redis | Persistent caching across multiple services |
| Hazelcast | Distributed cache for fault tolerance |
| Ehcache | Java-based caching with expiration policies |


Since you're focusing on microservices and cloud-native tools, adopting Redis or Hazelcast would give you scalable, fault-tolerant caching. Want to dive into cache eviction policies and strategies used in these systems?
Great! Cache eviction strategies are crucial in maintaining performance and preventing memory overuse in distributed caching systems like Redis, Hazelcast, and Ehcache. These strategies decide which items to remove when the cache reaches its memory limit.
1. Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Removes the least accessed items first.
- Used in Redis by default (maxmemory-policy lru).
- Works well for frequently accessed data.
CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru


✅ Best for: Web applications, API response caching.

2. Least Frequently Used (LFU)
- Removes items with the fewest hits.
- More effective than LRU in some cases (tracks frequency).
- Redis supports this using allkeys-lfu.
✅ Best for: Long-running caches with heavy data variation.

3. Time-To-Live (TTL) Expiration
- Auto-deletes entries after a fixed time.
- Ideal for session management and temporary caching.
- Supported in Redis: EXPIRE key seconds.
✅ Best for: Caching temporary authentication tokens.

4. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Removes oldest inserted items first.
- Used in basic queue-like caching.
✅ Best for: Task queues, event-driven systems.

Which One Should You Use?
| Cache | Best Strategy |
| Redis | LRU / LFU / TTL |
| Hazelcast | TTL / LRU |
| Ehcache | LRU / FIFO |


For microservices, combining TTL and LRU ensures efficient caching without excessive memory use
